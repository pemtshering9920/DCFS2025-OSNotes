### Introduction to Operating System
An **operating system(OS)** is a software controlling the operation of a computer system and its resources. Among other things, there's one very important criteria common to all operating systems:

``Capable of loading and executing user programs providing standardized (hardware-independent) input / output interface for them.``

**Major functions of operating systems may include:**

- [ ] Managing memory and other system resources.
- [ ] Imposing security and access policies.
- [ ] Scheduling and multiplexing processes and threads.
- [ ] Launching and closing user programs dynamically.
- [ ] Providing a basic user interface and application programmer interface.
      
``` Note: Not every operating system offers all of these features. For example, single-tasking systems like MS-DOS do not handle process scheduling, while embedded systems like eCOS might lack a user interface or only support a fixed set of user programs. ```

**An operating system (OS) consists of several key components that work together to manage hardware resources and provide services for software applications. The main components of an OS include:**

- [ ] **Kernel:** The core part of the OS, responsible for managing hardware resources (like CPU, memory, and I/O devices), process management, and system calls. It acts as an intermediary between hardware and software.

- [ ] **Process Management:** This includes handling processes (programs in execution), scheduling them for execution, and managing process states and resources.

- [ ] **Memory Management:** Responsible for managing the system’s memory (RAM), including allocating and deallocating memory for processes, ensuring efficient memory usage, and providing virtual memory when needed.

- [ ] **File System:** Manages the storage, organization, retrieval, and manipulation of files on storage devices. It includes defining file names, directories, and file operations like read/write.

- [ ] **Device Drivers:** Specialized programs that allow the OS to communicate with hardware devices like printers, keyboards, and network adapters.

- [ ] **User Interface:** Provides an interface for users to interact with the OS, which can be command-line (CLI) or graphical (GUI). It allows users to run programs, manage files, and perform other tasks.

- [ ] **System Utilities and Libraries:** A set of programs that provide basic services for applications, such as text editors, file management tools, and networking utilities.

- [ ] **Networking:** Manages network connections and protocols, enabling communication between devices over a network.

- [ ] **Security and Access Control:** Ensures the system’s integrity by controlling user permissions, authentication, and data encryption.


### What is a kernel?
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**The kernel of an operating system is something you will never see. It basically enables any other programs to execute. It handles events generated by hardware (called interrupts) and software (called system calls), and manages access to resources.**

The **hardware event handlers (interrupt handlers)** will for instance get the number of the key you just pressed, and convert it to the corresponding character stored in a buffer so some program can retrieve it.

The **system calls** are initiated by user-level programs, for opening files, starting other programs, etc. Each **system call handler** will have to check whether the arguments passed are valid, then perform the internal operation to complete the request.

Most user programs do not directly issue system calls (except for asm programs, for instance), but instead use a standard library which does the ugly job of formatting arguments as required by the kernel and generating the system call. (For example, the C function fopen() eventually calls a kernel function that actually opens the file.)

The kernel usually defines a few abstractions like files, processes, sockets, directories, etc. which correspond to an internal state it remembers about last operations, so that a program may issue a session of operation more efficiently.

**Types of Kernels:**

- [ ] **Monolithic Kernel** – A large kernel where all OS services, including memory management, process scheduling, and device drivers, run in a single address space (*e.g., Linux, UNIX*).

- [ ] **Microkernel** – Provides only essential functions like IPC and basic memory management, while other services run in user space, increasing modularity and security (*e.g., Minix, QNX*).

- [ ] **Hybrid Kernel** – Combines elements of both monolithic and microkernels, optimizing performance and modularity (*e.g., Windows NT, macOS XNU*).


### Introduction to Linux
______________________________

**Linux is a Unix-like, open-source operating system that provides a multi-user, multitasking environment. It features a modular design, strict user permissions, and a robust security model, making it widely used for servers, cloud computing, and embedded systems.**

**History of Operating Systems**

1. **Windows (1985):** Microsoft's first graphical user interface (GUI) operating system.

2. **UNIX:** Developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, and Brian Kernighan. UNIX is a multi-user, multitasking OS written in the C programming language, which made it highly portable across different computer systems.

3. **Linux:** Created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It combines the Linux kernel with system utilities and applications to form a complete operating system.


<details>  Free Software and Open Source Movement

Richard Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1984 to promote software freedom.

GNU Project (GNU = GNU's Not UNIX) was started to create an open-source UNIX-like operating system.

Linux kernel + GNU tools = Linux OS

Linux is widely used in desktops, servers, cloud computing, mobile devices, and embedded systems. </details>



-[ ] **Android, the most popular mobile OS, is a modified version of the Linux kernel but does not use GNU utilities.**



### Linux Kernel and Versioning

The Linux kernel is regularly updated. An example of a latest version number is 6.13.4, where:

6 = Major version

13 = Minor update

4 = Bug fixes and patches


### Linux Distributions (Distros)

A Linux distribution is a packaged version of Linux that includes the kernel, GNU utilities, a package manager, and additional applications. *Examples:*

- [ ] *Debian-based: Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Parrot OS*

- [ ] *Red Hat-based: Fedora, CentOS, RHEL*

- [ ] *Arch-based: Manjaro, BlackArch*

- [ ] *Others: openSUSE, Alpine Linux*


### Hypevisors (Virtual machines)
__________________________________
A **hypervisor** is software or hardware that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) by abstracting and allocating physical resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.) to multiple isolated environments. It allows running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. There are two types of hypervisors:

**Type 1 (Bare Metal):** Runs directly on the hardware without the need for an underlying operating system. It is efficient and provides better performance since it interacts directly with the hardware.
*Example: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen*

**Type 2 (Hosted):** Runs on top of an existing operating system. It is less efficient than Type 1 because it depends on the host OS to manage resources.
*Example: VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox*

Hypervisors enable system administrators to run multiple VMs on a single physical machine, which improves resource utilization and simplifies management.

**Types of Virtualization**

- [ ] **Full Virtualization:** The hypervisor simulates a complete physical machine for the guest OS, making the guest OS unaware that it's running in a virtualized environment. It can run any OS as a guest.
*Example: VMware ESXi, KVM*

- [ ] **Para-Virtualization:** The guest OS is aware that it's running in a virtualized environment. It communicates directly with the hypervisor for better performance, but it needs to be specially adapted.
*Example: Xen, VMware vSphere*

- [ ] **Containerization:** Rather than virtualizing entire OSs, containers virtualize applications and their dependencies. It’s more lightweight than traditional VMs and typically provides faster start-up times and better resource efficiency.
*Example: Docker, Kubernetes*


### Differences Between Linux and Windows
______________________________________________



| Feature | Linux (CLI) | Windows (GUI) |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Interface | Command-Line Interface (CLI) | Graphical User Interface (GUI) |
| Operating System Type | Open-source, Unix-like OS, source code freely available and modifiable | Proprietary, closed-source OS, limited customization of core components |
| User Interface | 	Multiple desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, etc.), highly customizable can be less polished |	Consistent, user-friendly interface, simple and intuitive |
| Software Availability |	Wide variety of open-source software some proprietary software may not be available but alternatives exist |	Vast library of software, including most commercial applications and games |
| Security |	Generally more secure due to better permission systems and less targeted by malware	| More targeted by malware, but has improved security with features like Windows Defender |
| System Resources	| More lightweight, runs well on older hardware, efficient	| Requires more resources, especially newer versions, may struggle on older hardware |
| Command-Line Usage |	Heavy reliance on CLI for system administration, learning curve for new users	| Command Prompt and PowerShell available, but most users interact with GUI |

|Customizability	| Highly customizable, almost every aspect of the system can be tweaked	| Less customizable, especially with respect to core components of the OS |


### Linux Shell and Terminal
__________________________________
The **terminal (also called a shell)** is the interface where users type commands to interact with the system.

Common Shells:

1. **sh** (Bourne Shell)

2. **bash (Bourne Again Shell)** - Default shell in most Linux distros

3. **csh** (C Shell)

4. **zsh** (Z Shell)

5. **ksh** (Korn Shell)


### Logging Into a Linux System

**Graphical Login:** User logs in through the GUI.

**Virtual Console:** A text-based login available by pressing `` Ctrl + Alt + F1 `` to `` Ctrl + Alt + F6 `` .


### User Roles in Linux

1. **Root User (Administrator / Super User):** Has complete control over the system.

2. **Normal User:** Has restricted access to prevent accidental damage.

`` Note: Best Practice is to never log in as root directly. Use  ' sudo ' to execute administrative tasks. ``


### Linux Commands
__________________________
For the full list of commands, you can view or download the [Linux Commands](https://github.com/pemtshering9920/DCFS2025-OSNotes/blob/main/LinuxNotesForProfessionals.pdf)

**Navigating Directories:**

``cd`` Change the current directory ``cd`` takes you to the home directory of the logged-in user.

``cd ..`` : Moves one level up in the directory structure.

`` cd - ``: Takes you to the previous working directory


### Linux File Hierarchy Structure:

Files and directories in Linux are organized in a single rooted tree structure (``/``).

Paths are delimited by ``/``.

*Example: ``/home/hiron`` represents the directory named ``hiron`` inside ``/home``.*

**File Name Sensitivity:** Linux file names are case-sensitive. Therefore, ``anna.txt``, ``Anna.txt``, ``AnnA.txt``, and ``ANNA.txt`` are considered distinct files.

**Home Directory (``~``):** Each user has their own ``home`` directory, represented as ``~``.

*Example: ``/home/username`` is the home directory for the user ``username``, and ``/root`` is the home directory for the ``root`` user.*


### Common Directories in Linux:

- [ ] **Home Directories:** ``/home/username`` , ``/root`` : Each user has a home directory where personal files and settings are stored.
- [ ] **User Executables:** ``/bin`` , ``/usr/bin`` , ``/usr/local/bin`` : These directories store binary executables (programs and commands) for users.
- [ ] **System Executables:** ``/sbin`` , ``/usr/sbin`` , ``/usr/local/sbin`` : These directories contain executables for system maintenance and administrative tasks.
- [ ] **Mountpoints:** ``/media`` , ``/mnt`` : Directories for mounting external devices (e.g., USB drives, CDs).
- [ ] **Configuration Files:** ``/etc`` : System-wide configuration files for applications and the operating system.
- [ ] **Temporary Files:** ``/tmp`` : Files that are temporarily created by the system or applications.
- [ ] **Kernels and Bootloader:** ``/boot`` : Contains boot-related files, including the Linux kernel.
- [ ] **Server Data:** ``/var``, ``/srv`` : Directories that contain variable data (e.g., logs, caches, databases).
- [ ] **System Information:** ``/proc``, ``/sys`` : Virtual filesystems providing information about the system, processes, and hardware.
- [ ] **Shared Libraries:** ``/lib``, ``/usr/lib``, ``/usr/local/lib`` : Contain shared libraries required by programs to run.
